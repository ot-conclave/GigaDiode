Choice of power regulator: LTC3622
Rationale:
- availability
- synchronous rectification (significant due to very low 1.1V output rail)
- dual output
- 1A capability

Passives Selection Process:

----------

Using Ceramic Output Capacitors, page 14, left column.

C_{out} = 3 \frac{ \Delta I_{out} }{ f_0 * V_{droop} }

Worst case I_out step change is from energy-detect mode to 1000base-T mode, on
both PHYs simultaneously.  That's 2 * (160 - 10)mA = 0.30A.

For higher efficiency, we'll select the no-dash part number which runs at
1 MHz, instead of the dash-two 2.25 MHz part.  We can afford the extra board
area required for the larger inductors and capacitors.  So f_0 = 1e6 Hz.

For V_droop, the LAN8830 data sheet section 6.2 Operating Conditions specifies
a supply voltage range of 1.067 to 1.121V for the VDD11*, so that's +10%/-3%
(yikes), and V_droop = 0.033V.

The calculation thus yields C_out = 27.27 uF, for the 1.1V side.

----------

For the 2.5V rail, delta_I_out = 2*((13+81) - (16+18))mA = 0.120A.

Acceptable V_droop is (2.5 - 2.375V) = 0.125V, from the same table as above.

Thus C_out = 2.88 uF, for the 2.5V side.

----------

Inductor Selection, page 14, right column.

L = \frac{ V_{out} }{ f * \Delta I_L } (1 - \frac{ V_{out} }{ V_{in(max)} })

USB specifies that V_in(max) = 5.25V.

We could allow ripple current to get up to 50% of I_out(max), which would be
170mA for the 1.1V side and 103mA for the 2.5V side.  Let's start there and
see what L-values that gets us, then adjust as desired.

L_{1.1V} = 5.11 uH
L_{2.5V} = 12.71 uH

Looking at 5.8x5.8mm square shielded inductors between 5.3 - 8.2 uH with a
certain pad style, namely two pads with a circular cutout in the middle, and
sorting by minimum copper resistance, we find two substitutable candidates for
L_{1.1V}, both of which are 4.2 uH which cuts the ripple current down to 25%:
- Bourns SRR5028-6R2Y
- Wuerth 744053006

The same inquiry for L_{2.5V}, looking between 12 - 27 uH, yields a 15uH,
100 mohm inductor:
- Bourns SRR5028-150Y
- Wuerth 744053150

----------

Input capacitor..... the datasheet guidance sucks, I'm just going to go with
the 10 uF generic recommendation.

And then I'll do the same 47 uH input filter, with 44uF+2.1ohm damper in
parallel with the 10 uF C_in.

----------

So the 47 uH input coil... LTspice says it will see 2.7A inrush for about 0.1
milliseconds.  So it needs to have a saturation current above that, which means
it is going to be huge.  Oh well.

In the 12x12mm size, we have any of the following, however some of them have
different land patterns.....
- Bourns SRR1210-470M
- Bourns SRR1210A-470M
- Wurth 7447706470
- Wurth 7447709470
- Wurth 784770470
- Wurth 7847709470

Upon placing that huge inductor in the layout, it seems incredibly
disproportionately too large.  Maybe a slightly lower inductance could be okay,
to get to a smaller package (but gotta keep Isat >= 3.0A).  How about Bourns
SRN6045TA-220M, it's 22uH, 96 mohm, 3.3A Isat, semi-shielded, and only
6.0x6.0mm.  Except... uh-oh, the smaller inductance means it will experience a
higher Ipeak.

How about Panasonic ETQ-P4M470KFM, a 47uH at 7.4x7.0mm.
